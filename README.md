Objective: The goal of this experiment is to design and develop an AI-powered chatbot that can handle customer inquiries, provide support, and improve customer experience in a retail environment. Create prompts using various AI prompting techniques to guide your experiment, data collection, analysis, and report creation.

## Aim: 
To design, implement, and evaluate an AI-powered chatbot for a retail environment using diverse prompting techniques, with the objective of handling customer inquiries, improving support efficiency, and enhancing customer experience.

2.Define Techniques → List prompting methods (zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based, contextual, instruction-based, Socratic, comparative, persona-driven).

3.Design Prompts → Create sample customer queries and apply each technique to the same queries.

4.Execute Prompts → Run prompts on AI systems (ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, etc.).

5.Collect Outputs → Record AI responses for each scenario and technique.

6.Analyze Responses → Compare results for clarity, accuracy, empathy, personalization, and effectiveness.

7.Document Results → Present findings with side-by-side comparisons.

8.Conclude → Identify which techniques give the best customer experience.
